# Mobile-Robot
 A mobile robot is made by undergraduate students. I'm the project subleader and software manager.

We made a mobile robot that can trace lines using a photo reflector, park in a garage using a PD control with an encoder, search for a goal using an ultrasonic sensor and a distance measurement module, and press a button.
